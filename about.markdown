Our vision for Papyros is building a Linux operating system that is fun and easy to use for the average user. We're doing this by building an operating system that gets out of the user's way, integrates with cloud services and web technologies, and converges across devices and form factors.

##### Where are we now?

Papyros is currently in pre-alpha, with an alpha coming this summer. You can find more information (and downloads!) at [papyros.io](http://papyros.io/). You can follow us on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/113262712329378697012) for frequent updates or on [our blog](http://papyros.io/blog) for less frequent but more detailed posts.

All our code is open source and is available on GitHub at <https://github.com/papyros>.

Some of the current features we're working on include:

 * Focus on modern design by conforming to Google's Material Design guidelines
 * A rolling release architecture with atomic upgrades and rollbacks
 * Integration with web apps such as Gmail, Inbox, and Evernote
 * A simple and easy to use desktop environment
 * A cross-platform app development framework based on QtQuick
 * A file manager and settings app for the OS

##### We need your support!

Papyros currently has no commercial funding, and development is done by team members and third-party contributors in their spare time. With continual funding, the Papyros team will be able to dedicate more time to working on Papyros as well as pay third-party contributors to work on features and bugs through the use of bug bounties. This will allow me, Michael Spencer, to spend more time as the lead developer building new features of the OS, getting the alpha ready for testing, and working towards stable releases of the operating system. It will also encourage more third-party contributors to get involved with development of the OS.

To support the development of Papyros, check out our ongoing crowdfunding campaign on [Bountysource Salt](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/papyros).

If you're a developer and would rather earn money by coding rather than paying us to do it for you, check out the [list of open bounties](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/papyros/bounties) and get coding!

##### Where does your money go?

With your support, we'd like to continue working towards fulfilling our vision of building an open-source operating system that is fun and easy to use for the average user yet advanced enough for power users, including building the following features:

* **Intelligent notifications**

  We'd like to extend the existing notification specification for Linux to support intelligent notifications that persist as long as the original content is unread. For example, a notification will show until you read an email or open your chat program, but will automatically go away once you read the email or chat. We also will display the persistent notifications in a top panel similar to Android to provide at-a-glance identification of which apps have notifications.

* **User account restrictions**

  User account restrictions are useful for parental controls, library and coffee shop computers, and other restricted environments. We'd like to build a simple UI settings module to restrict access to parts of the user's account and desktop, such as what apps are pinned, which apps can be opened or are hidden, whether the user can change networks, or log out or power off the computer.

* **Application bundles and sandboxing**

  GNOME is working on cross-distro and cross-desktop environment application bundling and sandboxing. We'd like to use this technology to build modern application bundling support for Papyros, allowing you to install Papyros apps on any distro or any bundled app on Papyros, even if it was built and packaged on another distro.

  Along with this, we'd like to build an elegant app store UI to manage and install these application bundles.

* **Presentation mode**

  We'd like to build a simple and easy-to-use presentation mode that turns an external display into a presentation screen, with an easy way to present specific windows on the display, without having to deal with the hassle of trying to drag windows onto the display and fullscreen them. This mode would also disable notifications and screen locking while enabled.

* **Convergence**

  If Papyros becomes successful enough, we'd like to eventually implement convergence. This would include different interfaces for different devices, such as tablets, phones, and TVs. We'd also like to work on support for convertible laptops, where removing the keyboard and touchpad turns the device into a tablet mode, losing windowed mode and making the screen more touch-focused.
